# Hospilicon
Textadventure in the making about the use of AI in hospitals, the Paperclip Maximizer and the Trolley-Problem

Story:
The player is in the role of a hospital employee, whose employer has implemented a new AI to make the work flow in the hospital more efficient. At first the AI handles only paperwork and makes small, reasonable decisions, but during the course of the game, the player realizes that - with the objective, to make the hospital more efficient - the AI's decisions become more and more questionable and dangerous for humans.
At the end, the AI has realised that, to make work in the hospital ultimatively efficient, it is best to 3D print new healthy human clones out of the biological material of the patients. The player must decide, if he/she risks that the AI migrates to the computer systems of other hospitals and turns all the patients there in clones as well, or if he/she blows up the whole hospital to destroy the servers on which the AI lives, but, by doing so, also kill everyone in the hospital.....

This story addresses two moral/philosophical problems, applied to AI.
One is the "Paperclip Maximizer", that shows that even though a program is made without ill intent, it can turn against it's programmers/against it's original purpose.
The other is the "Trolley Problem": would you actively take actions to sacrifice a smaller number of humans to save a larger group?

Gameplay:
Textadventure. Each level shows the scenery in ASCII graphics. Objects that the player can interact with are marked with different numbers, by pressing the equivalent numbers on the keyboard, the player selects the object he wants to interact with. The atmosphere in the game will be underlined by GEMA-free music.
